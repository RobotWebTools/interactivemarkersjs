InteractiveMarkers.js provides an implementation of [Interactive Markers](http://www.ros.org/wiki/interactive_markers) 
for the web based on ros.js and three.js.
The library is designed to be modular, lightweight and follows the UMD convention. 

Modules:
 * markersthree.js: Visualizes Marker messages in three.js
 * threeinteraction.js: Mouse Interaction library for three.js
 * imtunnel.js: Client to an Interactive Marker tunnel server via ros.js
 * imthree.js: View Interactive Markers using the above libraries
